Energy production in Denmark:

1. **Minutes1UTC**: This column likely represents a timestamp indicating the time at which the data was recorded. It serves as a primary key for each record in the dataset.


2. **CO2Emission**: This column likely represents the amount of carbon dioxide emissions associated with energy production. It could be measured in units such as metric tons or kilograms per unit of energy produced.

3. **ProductionGe100MW**: This column could represent the production of energy generated by power plants with a capacity of 100 megawatts or greater. It likely measures the output of electricity in megawatts (MW) from such power plants.

4. **ProductionLt100MW**: Similar to the previous column, but specifically for power plants with a capacity of less than 100 megawatts.

5. **SolarPower**: This column likely represents the production of energy generated from solar sources, measured in megawatts or another unit of power.

6. **OffshoreWindPower**: Represents the production of energy generated from offshore wind farms, typically measured in megawatts.

7. **OnshoreWindPower**: Represents the production of energy generated from onshore wind farms, typically measured in megawatts.

8. **Exchange_Sum**: This column may represent the total energy exchange between Denmark and other countries, measured in units such as megawatt-hours (MWh) or gigawatt-hours (GWh). Positive values indicate exports, while negative values indicate imports.

9. **Exchange_DK1_DE, Exchange_DK1_NL, Exchange_DK1_GB, Exchange_DK1_NO, Exchange_DK1_SE, Exchange_DK1_DK2, Exchange_DK2_DE, Exchange_DK2_SE, Exchange_Bornholm_SE**: These columns likely represent specific energy exchange values between Denmark and different neighboring countries or regions. For example:
    - `Exchange_DK1_DE`: Energy exchange between Denmark and Germany.
    - `Exchange_DK1_NL`: Energy exchange between Denmark and the Netherlands.
    - `Exchange_DK1_GB`: Energy exchange between Denmark and Great Britain.
    - `Exchange_DK1_NO`: Energy exchange between Denmark and Norway.
    - `Exchange_DK1_SE`: Energy exchange between Denmark and Sweden.
    - `Exchange_DK1_DK2`: Energy exchange between different regions within Denmark.
    - `Exchange_DK2_DE`: Energy exchange between another region in Denmark and Germany.
    - `Exchange_DK2_SE`: Energy exchange between another region in Denmark and Sweden.
    - `Exchange_Bornholm_SE`: Energy exchange between the island of Bornholm (a region of Denmark) and Sweden.

These columns provide insights into the energy landscape in Denmark, including the sources of energy production (e.g., wind, solar), carbon emissions, and the dynamics of energy exchange with neighboring countries. Analyzing these metrics over time can help understand trends, dependencies, and the overall efficiency and sustainability of Denmark's energy sector.
